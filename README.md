Task 6 – Strong Password Creation & Evaluation
Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by creating one, testing it with an online strength checker, and analyzing the results.
Tools Used
PasswordMeter.com – Free online password strength checker

Steps Followed
Created multiple passwords with variations in:
Length
Uppercase letters
Lowercase letters
Numbers
Symbols
Tested each password on PasswordMeter.com.
Recorded the scores, complexity ratings, and feedback.
Selected the strongest password based on score and feedback.
Researched common password attacks and best practices for password creation.

Final Password Evaluation
Tool Result:
Score: 98%
Complexity: Very Strong

Additions:
Length: 13 characters (+52)
Uppercase letters: 3 (+24)
Lowercase letters: 8 (+10)
Numbers: 3 (+12)
Symbols: 1 (+6)
Middle numbers/symbols: 3 (+6)
Requirements met: 5/5 (+10)

Deductions:
Repeat characters: (-1)
Consecutive lowercase letters: (-14)
Consecutive numbers: (-4)
Sequential numbers: (-3)

Final Verdict:
The password exceeds minimum standards and is rated "Very Strong".

Key Learnings / Best Practices
Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Make passwords longer (12+ characters for better resistance against brute force).
Avoid predictable sequences (e.g., 123, abc).
Avoid repeated characters.
Place numbers/symbols in the middle for more complexity.

Common Password Attacks & Prevention
Brute Force Attack: Try every possible combination.
Prevention: Long, complex passwords.

Dictionary Attack: Use common words from a dictionary.
Prevention: Avoid real words or predictable phrases.

Phishing: Trick users into revealing passwords.
Prevention: Verify sources before entering credentials.

Credential Stuffing: Using stolen passwords from breaches.
Prevention: Unique passwords for each account.

Additional Security Measures
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds extra verification.

Password Managers: Store complex passwords securely.

Passphrases: Use random, unrelated words for memorability.
